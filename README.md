## Supplies
- 1x buck boost 9-35 to 1-35V 80W
- 1x Volt/Amp meter display
- 2x banana jack binding post
- 1x 1K potentiometer (3590S)
- 1x 100k potentiometer (3590S)
- 1x  DC Power Jack Socket (5.5 x 2.5mm)

## Premise

1. Typical laptop batteries adapt wall (120V 60hz) voltage to 20V DC for laptops.
2. Use a buck books rated above the maximum rating of the laptop charger to convert the 20V output to a voltage range suitable for electronics projects.
3. Add large 3590S potentiometers for easier user handling
4. Use a inexpensive Volt/Amp meter display to display the voltage
5. A DC Power Jack Socket is needed to adapt laptop charger to DC-DC converter input.
